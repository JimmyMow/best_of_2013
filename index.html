                Starter Night for my Spring term at TSL was one of the best moments I've ever had. I went up and presented my idea, The Fan's Challenge, and for some odd reason people enjoyed it. I got an email from Neal saying how that was one of the best Starter Night presentations he had seen, and also got an email from Jason Fried which then turned into a relationship. Afterwards, Harsha and I left to go to my house, we were greeted by a bunch of my friends and had a little too much fun which ended with Harsha pooping on this girls porch.

              On my summer team the leagues games were at Fleetwood, the "Ghetto HQ" of Evanston. As Harsha as my witness, I would be the only white kid there, every time. One game, we were down like 5 or so to a bad team in the first half.  My teammates were yelling at me for not shooting the ball. In the second half, I let it fly and it was just one of those nights. I ended up scoring around 15 or so, and after one step back 3 which sent the defender the wrong way the crowd chanted "white boy" for about a minute. Good times.

                This past summer I got drafted into an Evanston league and played for the "Orange". I had a blast, every week there would be at least a hundred people at our game.

                This past year was a lot of stress leaving college and a lot of coding after I found out programming is what I want to pursue and learn. Over winter break, I took my first real social break since summer and went on a trip to U of I with some of my best friends for New Years...lol.

                After leaving college I really had no idea what I was going to do. I knew I was a bright kid, but college is supposed to be everything when your are 19, and for me it was the opposite. Luckily, I was advised to try coding because of my chess skills, and sign up for The Starter League. That was one of the best decisions I've ever made in my short 19 year career of making decisions. This evolved into meeting a ton of cool people including Jason Fried, and eventually being a student at Starter School.
